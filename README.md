# lib4jformats

This C++17 library implements the properitary file types 4J Studios made for Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition. 

With an optional dependency on [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), some file types can be converted to and from JSON.

This includes:
- .ARC (Archive file)
- .LOC (Localization file)
- .COL (Color file)
- .PCK (Pack file)
- .MSSCMP (Miles Sound System Soundbank)

This does not cover game saves, or anything the can write to.
For that, there is [libLCE](https://github.com/DexrnZacAtack/libLCE).
