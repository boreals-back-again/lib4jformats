# Logo Information

![lib4jformats logo \(SVG\)](logo/l4jf.svg)

The lib4jformats logo is playfully derivative of the original 4J Studios logo, while remaining visually serious.

The font used is named Kairos Sans, likely not the same as the original, but it's good enough.

There are two logos, with light and black text so the logo can look good on both light and dark modes.
